		"It's a very simple JavaScript app embedded in a web page. It's so simple, there's almost nothing to it. I've shared the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/myWord\">source code</a> on GitHub, and licensed it as open source, so you can see for yourself, and use it however you like.",

				"The app reads a simple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\">JSON</a> format. Here's an example <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36518280/misc/myWordDemo.json\">file</a>. The text you're reading right now comes from a <a href=\"http://myword.io/essay.json\">JSON file</a>. It would be really easy to create a simple text editor that produces these files, hiding the technical details from users.",
				"There's a standalone public web page version at <a href=\"http://myword.io/\">myword.io</a>. It takes an optional <i>url</i> parameter, which specifies the address of the JSON file to use. If none is specified, we read the file <i>essay.json</i> in the same directory as the HTML page. ",
